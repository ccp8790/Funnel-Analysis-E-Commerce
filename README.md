# Funnel-Analysis-E-Commerce

Funnel analysis is a useful tool to understand the steps required to reach an outcome on a website and how many users get through each of those steps. In this project, I perform funnel analysis for an e-commerce website, which consists of four stages:

* home page
* search and item page
* cart page (requires payment info)
* order page (payment confirmation)

in three aspects:
* funnel conversion rate for different devices (desktop/mobile) and genders
* study the impacts of genders
* build an XGBoost model with SMOTE oversampling to predict whether a user will put an order, and plot the feature importance
